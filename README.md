# functional fun
This project is an amalgamation of all the different things I'm trying out in the functional world. It is not a real application.

- Semigroup
- Monoid
- Monad
- Typeclass (cats, http4s)
- ZIO
- dockerized integration tests


TODO: what about tests for IOApp http4s server?
TODO: how can I create a docker image with my server?
